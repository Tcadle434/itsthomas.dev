                Hey, I'm Thomas. Some of you may know me as <b>Blockchief</b> on
                twitter.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for startups and
                blockchain projects. My current focus is on the development of
                consumer-facing products for the crypto space at BlockStop, a
                company that I co-founded. My favorie tech stack consists of
                NextJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, tRPC, and Prisma.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p className="text-md m-0 text-zinc-300">
                Prior to BlockStop, I was as a senior software engineer at
                Capial One. I primarlily worked on the Digital Messaging
                division, building out high performance, AWS cloud based
                microservices and APIs. Before that I graduated with a Computer
                Engineering degree from Penn State University.

              <p className="text-md m-0 text-zinc-300">
                I'm as interested in building businesses as I am in actually
                writing code. It is a skillset that I hope to continue to grow
                as I learn more from my experiences and the people around me.
              </p>

              <p className="text-md m-0 text-zinc-300">
                Aside from my work life, I love to golf, ski, and play video
                games. On top of that, you'll find me frequently poking around
                on twitter, where I stay active with my favorite crypto
                communities.
