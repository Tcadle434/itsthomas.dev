## My Personal Website

I wanted to create a website that was easy to direct people to, and that I could use to showcase some of my work. I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to experiment with minimalism in terms of design and development. This project was initialed with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) which is my current go-to for building anything on the web.
